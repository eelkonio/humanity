# Moral Frameworks: Competing Visions of the Good

## Overview

All human societies develop moral frameworks—systems of values distinguishing right from wrong, good from bad. Yet these frameworks vary dramatically across cultures and philosophical traditions. Understanding both universal moral intuitions and cultural variation reveals the foundations and limits of human ethics.

## Major Moral Frameworks

| Framework | Core Principle | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Consequentialism** | Maximize good outcomes | Clear decision procedure | Difficult calculations, counterintuitive implications |
| **Deontology** | Follow moral rules/duties | Respects rights, clear obligations | Rigid, conflicts between duties |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Cultivate good character | Holistic, realistic | Vague guidance, cultural variation |
| **Divine Command** | Obey God's will | Absolute authority, motivation | Which God? Euthyphro dilemma |
| **Social Contract** | Mutual agreement | Justifies cooperation | Excludes non-contractors |
| **Care Ethics** | Relationships and care | Recognizes emotions, context | Potentially parochial |

## Moral Foundations Theory

Jonathan Haidt identifies six universal moral foundations:
1. **Care/Harm**: Compassion for suffering
2. **Fairness/Cheating**: Justice and reciprocity
3. **Loyalty/Betrayal**: Group allegiance
4. **Authority/Subversion**: Respect for hierarchy
5. **Sanctity/Degradation**: Purity and disgust
6. **Liberty/Oppression**: Freedom from domination

**Key insight**: Different cultures and political groups weight these foundations differently, producing moral conflicts.

## Moral Disagreement

Why do moral disagreements persist?

**Sources**:
- Different foundational values
- Different empirical beliefs
- Different cultural contexts
- Motivated reasoning
- Identity-protective cognition

**Consequence**: Moral conflicts often intractable because rooted in fundamental value differences, not factual disagreements.
