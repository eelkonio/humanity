# Technological Determinism: Technology's Influence on Society

## Overview

Technological determinism is the idea that technology shapes society more than society shapes technology. While not absolute, technology does constrain and enable social possibilities, often in ways unintended by creators. Understanding this dynamic reveals how human-created tools reshape human nature and society.

## Technology Shapes Society

Examples:
- **Printing press** → Reformation, Enlightenment, nationalism
- **Telegraph** → Time zones, news cycles, financial markets
- **Automobile** → Suburbs, highways, oil dependence
- **Television** → Mass culture, political campaigns
- **Internet** → Globalization, social media, surveillance

## Unintended Consequences

Technologies produce effects beyond intentions:
- Social media: Connection → polarization, addiction
- Smartphones: Convenience → distraction, anxiety
- Automation: Efficiency → unemployment, inequality
- AI: Capability → control problems, existential risk
