# Technology: Technological Impacts on Humanity

## Overview

Technology profoundly shapes human life, enabling unprecedented capabilities while creating novel problems. Understanding technology's impacts—both beneficial and harmful—reveals how human-created tools reshape human nature and society in ways we struggle to control.

## Key Themes

### Technological Determinism

Technology shapes society as much as society shapes technology. Understanding this bidirectional relationship reveals how technological change drives social change.

### Digital Age Problems

Digital technologies create new forms of dysfunction: addiction, surveillance, manipulation, polarization, and disconnection despite promises of connection.

### AI and Automation

Artificial intelligence and automation promise transformation but threaten displacement, inequality, and potentially existential risk.

### Information Overload

Modern information abundance creates cognitive overload, attention fragmentation, and difficulty distinguishing signal from noise.
