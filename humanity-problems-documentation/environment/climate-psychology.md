# Climate Psychology: Psychological Barriers to Climate Action

## Overview

Despite scientific consensus on climate change risks, humanity fails to take adequate action. This failure stems from psychological barriers: cognitive biases, emotional responses, social dynamics, and political polarization that prevent effective response to the greatest challenge facing civilization.

## Psychological Barriers

### Cognitive Biases

- **Present bias**: Future consequences discounted
- **Optimism bias**: "Technology will solve it"
- **Availability heuristic**: Lack of dramatic immediate effects
- **Psychological distance**: Affects distant people/times
- **Confirmation bias**: Seeking agreeable information

### Emotional Barriers

- **Fear and anxiety**: Overwhelming, producing paralysis or denial
- **Guilt and shame**: Uncomfortable, triggering defensiveness
- **Helplessness**: Individual action seems pointless
- **Grief**: Loss of familiar world

### Social Barriers

- **Political polarization**: Climate as tribal identity marker
- **Social norms**: Consumption as status
- **Collective action**: Free-rider problems
- **Vested interests**: Fossil fuel industry resistance

## Responses to Climate Threat

- **Denial**: Rejecting scientific consensus
- **Apathy**: Accepting but not acting
- **Doom**: Believing it's too late
- **Action**: Working for solutions
