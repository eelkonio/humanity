# Ecological Disconnect: Separation from Natural Systems

## Overview

Modern humans are profoundly disconnected from the natural systems that sustain us. This psychological and physical separation makes environmental degradation abstract, enabling continued destruction of ecological foundations.

## Forms of Disconnect

- **Physical**: Urban living, indoor time
- **Psychological**: Nature as separate from human
- **Temporal**: Slow environmental changes invisible
- **Spatial**: Impacts distant from causes
- **Causal**: Complex systems obscure connections

## Consequences

- Environmental degradation seems abstract
- Ecological limits ignored
- Nature viewed as resource, not system
- Loss of ecological knowledge
- Reduced environmental concern
