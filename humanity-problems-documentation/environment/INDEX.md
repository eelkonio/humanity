# Environment: Human-Nature Relationships

## Overview

Humanity's relationship with the natural environment is fundamentally problematic. We depend on ecological systems for survival yet systematically degrade them. Understanding this paradox—destroying what we need—reveals deep psychological, social, and economic problems.

## Key Themes

### Ecological Disconnect

Modern humans are psychologically and physically disconnected from natural systems, making environmental degradation abstract and distant.

### Resource Depletion

Unsustainable resource use depletes the foundations of civilization, yet individual and collective incentives drive continued exploitation.

### Climate Psychology

Psychological barriers prevent adequate response to climate change despite scientific understanding of risks.

### Sustainability Challenges

Achieving sustainability requires overcoming coordination problems, short-term thinking, and vested interests.
