# Resource Depletion: Unsustainable Use of Finite Resources

## Overview

Humanity is depleting finite resources at unsustainable rates: fossil fuels, minerals, forests, fisheries, freshwater, topsoil. This depletion threatens civilization's foundations yet continues due to individual incentives, collective action failures, and short-term thinking.

## Major Depletions

| Resource | Status | Depletion Rate | Consequences |
|----------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Fossil Fuels** | Finite, declining | Decades remaining | Energy crisis, climate change |
| **Freshwater** | Aquifer depletion | Accelerating | Water scarcity, conflict |
| **Topsoil** | Erosion exceeds formation | 60 years at current rate | Agricultural collapse |
| **Fisheries** | 90% of large fish gone | Continuing | Food security, ecosystem collapse |
| **Forests** | Deforestation ongoing | Millions of hectares/year | Climate, biodiversity loss |
| **Minerals** | Peak production approaching | Variable | Economic disruption |

## Causes

- Tragedy of the commons
- Short-term economic incentives
- Population growth
- Consumption growth
- Technological optimism
- Discount future
