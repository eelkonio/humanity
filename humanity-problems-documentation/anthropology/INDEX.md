# Anthropology: Cultural Patterns Across Humanity

## Overview

Anthropology examines human cultures across time and space, revealing both universal patterns and remarkable diversity. While psychology focuses on individual minds and sociology on group dynamics, anthropology shows how these operate within cultural contexts that vary dramatically yet reflect common human needs and constraints.

**Key Insight**: Humans are cultural animals. We don't just have culture—we are constituted by culture. Language, beliefs, practices, and social structures shape not just behavior but cognition, emotion, and identity. Yet beneath cultural diversity lie universal human patterns rooted in our shared evolutionary heritage.

## Key Themes

### Cultural Universals and Variation

All human societies have language, kinship systems, rituals, moral codes, and social hierarchies—but the specific forms vary enormously. Understanding both universals and variation reveals what is intrinsically human versus culturally constructed.

### Cultural Evolution

Cultures evolve through variation, selection, and transmission—analogous to but distinct from biological evolution. Cultural evolution operates much faster than genetic evolution, enabling rapid adaptation but also creating mismatches and conflicts.

### The Anthropological Perspective

Anthropology provides critical distance from our own cultural assumptions, revealing that practices we consider natural or inevitable are often culturally specific. This perspective is essential for understanding humanity's problems, which are always culturally embedded.
