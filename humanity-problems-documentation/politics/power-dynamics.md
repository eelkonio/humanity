# Power Dynamics: Seeking, Maintaining, and Abusing Power

## Overview

Power—the capacity to influence others—is central to politics. Humans universally seek power, and power universally corrupts. Understanding power dynamics reveals why political problems persist across all systems and cultures.

## Types of Power

- **Coercive**: Force and threat
- **Economic**: Control of resources
- **Social**: Status and influence
- **Informational**: Knowledge and expertise
- **Normative**: Moral authority

## Power Corrupts

Lord Acton: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"

**Mechanisms**:
- Reduces empathy
- Increases entitlement
- Enables impunity
- Attracts corrupt individuals
- Creates echo chambers
