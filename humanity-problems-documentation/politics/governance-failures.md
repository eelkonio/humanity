# Governance Failures: Systematic Political Problems

## Overview

All governance systems fail in characteristic ways. Understanding these failure modes—from democratic dysfunction to authoritarian oppression—reveals inherent limits of political organization.

## Types of Governance Failures

| Failure Type | Mechanism | Examples | Consequences |
|--------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Capture** | Special interests control policy | Regulatory capture, lobbying | Policies serve elites |
| **Gridlock** | Inability to make decisions | Partisan polarization | Problems unaddressed |
| **Short-termism** | Electoral cycles drive policy | Infrastructure neglect | Long-term decline |
| **Information** | Poor knowledge for decisions | Intelligence failures | Bad policies |
| **Implementation** | Policies fail in execution | Bureaucratic dysfunction | Gap between intent and outcome |
