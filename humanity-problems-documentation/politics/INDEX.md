# Politics: Power and Governance

## Overview

Politics concerns the distribution and exercise of power—who gets what, when, and how. Political systems shape human life profoundly, yet all political systems face inherent problems: power corrupts, governance fails, democracy has limits, and coordination at scale is difficult.

## Key Themes

### Power Dynamics

Power—the ability to influence others—is universal in human societies. Understanding how power is sought, maintained, and abused reveals fundamental political problems.

### Governance Failures

All governance systems fail in characteristic ways. Understanding these failure modes is essential for improving political institutions.

### Democratic Limitations

Democracy is the least bad system, but it has inherent limitations that produce dysfunction and cannot be eliminated, only managed.

### Corruption

Corruption—abuse of power for private gain—is universal across political systems. Understanding its causes and consequences reveals deep problems in human governance.
