# Short-term Thinking: Temporal Discounting and Present Bias

## Overview

Humans systematically discount the future, overvaluing immediate rewards and undervaluing long-term consequences. This present bias—rooted in evolutionary psychology—produces unsustainable practices, inadequate long-term investment, and failure to address slow-moving catastrophes.

## Temporal Discounting

**Pattern**: Value decreases with time delay
- $100 today > $110 next year
- Pleasure now > greater pleasure later
- Avoid pain now > avoid greater pain later

**Hyperbolic discounting**: Steep near-term discounting, flatter long-term
- Inconsistent preferences over time
- Present self vs. future self conflict

## Causes

### Evolutionary

- Ancestral environment: immediate threats
- Uncertain future: bird in hand
- Short lifespans: future less relevant

### Psychological

- Cognitive limitations: future abstract
- Emotional: present vivid, future pale
- Uncertainty: future unknown

### Economic

- Interest rates: money now worth more
- Opportunity cost: alternative uses
- Risk: future uncertain

## Consequences

### Individual Level

- Inadequate savings
- Health neglect
- Education underinvestment
- Procrastination
- Addiction

### Societal Level

- Infrastructure decay
- Environmental degradation
- Climate change inaction
- Pension underfunding
- Research underinvestment
