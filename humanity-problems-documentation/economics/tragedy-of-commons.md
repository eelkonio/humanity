# Tragedy of the Commons: Collective Resource Management Failures

## Overview

The tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals acting in rational self-interest deplete shared resources, producing outcomes worse for everyone. This pattern—individual rationality producing collective irrationality—underlies many of humanity's most serious problems, from overfishing to climate change.

## The Classic Model

Garrett Hardin's 1968 formulation:
- Shared pasture (commons)
- Each herder benefits from adding animals
- Costs of overgrazing shared by all
- Rational individual choice: add animals
- Collective result: pasture destroyed

## Modern Commons Problems

| Commons | Individual Incentive | Collective Result | Status |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Atmosphere** | Emit greenhouse gases | Climate change | Worsening |
| **Oceans** | Maximize catch | Fishery collapse | Critical |
| **Forests** | Harvest timber | Deforestation | Ongoing |
| **Groundwater** | Pump water | Aquifer depletion | Severe |
| **Antibiotics** | Use when sick | Resistance | Growing |

## Solutions

### Institutional Approaches

- **Privatization**: Assign property rights
- **Regulation**: Government control
- **Community management**: Local governance
- **Markets**: Cap-and-trade systems

### Elinor Ostrom's Principles

Successful commons management requires:
1. Clear boundaries
2. Local rule-making
3. Monitoring
4. Graduated sanctions
5. Conflict resolution
6. Recognition of rights
7. Nested enterprises
