# Economics: Resource Allocation and Competition

## Overview

Economics examines how societies allocate scarce resources. Economic systems shape human behavior, opportunity, and well-being. Understanding economic dimensions of human problems reveals how material conditions, incentives, and market dynamics produce both prosperity and dysfunction.

## Key Themes

### Scarcity and Competition

Fundamental economic problem: unlimited wants, limited resources. This produces competition, inequality, and conflict.

### Inequality

Economic inequality affects health, happiness, social cohesion, and political stability. Understanding its causes and consequences is essential.

### Collective Action Problems

Economic version of coordination failures: individual rationality produces collective irrationality (tragedy of commons, free-riding).

### Short-term Thinking

Economic actors discount future, producing unsustainable practices and inadequate long-term investment.
