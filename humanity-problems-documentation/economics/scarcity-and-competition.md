# Scarcity and Competition: The Fundamental Economic Problem

## Overview

Scarcity—the gap between unlimited human wants and limited resources—is the fundamental economic problem. It produces competition, conflict, and zero-sum thinking. Understanding scarcity's psychological and social effects reveals why economic problems persist despite increasing abundance.

## Types of Scarcity

| Type | Nature | Examples | Psychological Impact |
|------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Absolute** | Insufficient for survival | Food, water in famine | Desperation, violence |
| **Relative** | Insufficient compared to others | Status goods, positional goods | Envy, status anxiety |
| **Artificial** | Created by institutions | Intellectual property, restricted access | Frustration, inequality |
| **Temporal** | Time limitations | 24 hours/day | Stress, trade-offs |

## Zero-Sum Thinking

Scarcity produces zero-sum mindset: one person's gain is another's loss

**Problems**:
- Prevents cooperation
- Fuels conflict
- Ignores positive-sum opportunities
- Creates winner-take-all dynamics
