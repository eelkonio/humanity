# Evolutionary Psychology: The Mismatch Between Past and Present

## Overview

Evolutionary psychology examines how natural selection shaped human psychology. Our minds evolved to solve problems faced by hunter-gatherer ancestors, not modern challenges. This evolutionary mismatch—ancient brains in modern environments—underlies many human problems.

## Key Concepts

### Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)

Human psychology evolved for:
- Small groups (50-150 people)
- Face-to-face interaction
- Physical threats
- Resource scarcity
- Immediate consequences
- Kin-based cooperation

Modern environment features:
- Mass societies (millions/billions)
- Digital interaction
- Abstract threats
- Resource abundance (for some)
- Delayed consequences
- Anonymous cooperation

**Result**: Systematic mismatch producing maladaptive behaviors

## Evolutionary Mismatches

| Adaptation | Ancestral Function | Modern Problem |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Sweet/fat preference** | Rare calories | Obesity, diabetes |
| **Threat detection** | Predator avoidance | Anxiety disorders |
| **Tribal psychology** | In-group cooperation | Racism, nationalism |
| **Status seeking** | Reproductive success | Status anxiety, inequality |
| **Present bias** | Immediate survival | Poor long-term planning |
| **Novelty seeking** | Exploration | Addiction, distraction |
