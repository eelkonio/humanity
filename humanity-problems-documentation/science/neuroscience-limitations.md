# Neuroscience Limitations: What Brain Science Cannot Tell Us

## Overview

Neuroscience has revealed much about brain function, but fundamental limitations remain. Understanding these limits is crucial for avoiding neuroscience hype and recognizing what brain science can and cannot explain about human behavior and experience.

## What Neuroscience Can Do

- Map brain structures and connections
- Identify neural correlates of mental states
- Reveal mechanisms of perception and action
- Show effects of damage and disease
- Demonstrate plasticity and change

## What Neuroscience Cannot (Yet) Do

- Explain consciousness (hard problem)
- Predict individual behavior reliably
- Read thoughts or intentions accurately
- Explain meaning and understanding
- Bridge neural activity to subjective experience

## The Explanatory Gap

**The hard problem of consciousness**: How do physical brain processes produce subjective experience? Why does it feel like something to be conscious?

**Current status**: No scientific explanation, multiple competing theories, fundamental mystery remains.

## Interconnections

This problem connects to:

- **[Cognitive Biases](../psychology/cognitive-biases.md)**: Neural basis
- **[Free Will](./scientific-method-limits.md)**: Determinism questions
- **[Reductionism](./reductionism-holism.md)**: Limits of neural explanation
