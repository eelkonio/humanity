# Science: Understanding Human Nature Through Empirical Investigation

## Overview

Science provides empirical understanding of human nature, revealing the biological, neurological, and evolutionary foundations of behavior. This scientific perspective illuminates why humans face certain problems while also revealing the limits of scientific understanding itself.

## Key Themes

### Evolutionary Psychology

Understanding human psychology through evolutionary lens reveals adaptive origins of behaviors that now cause problems—the evolutionary mismatch between ancestral and modern environments.

### Neuroscience and Limits

Brain science reveals mechanisms of cognition and emotion but also shows fundamental limits to self-understanding and control.

### Scientific Method Limits

Science is humanity's most successful knowledge-generating system, yet it has inherent limitations and can be misused.
