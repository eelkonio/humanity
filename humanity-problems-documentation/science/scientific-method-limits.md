# Scientific Method Limits: Epistemological Constraints

## Overview

Science is humanity's most successful knowledge-generating system, yet it has inherent limitations. Understanding these limits prevents scientism (treating science as the only valid knowledge) while maintaining respect for scientific inquiry.

## Inherent Limitations

### Scope Limitations

Science cannot address:
- **Normative questions**: What should be (values, ethics)
- **Metaphysical questions**: Ultimate nature of reality
- **Subjective experience**: Qualia, consciousness
- **Unique events**: Historical particulars
- **Meaning and purpose**: Existential questions

### Methodological Limitations

- **Replication crisis**: Many findings don't replicate
- **Publication bias**: Positive results published, negative ignored
- **Statistical issues**: P-hacking, multiple comparisons
- **Complexity**: Emergent phenomena resist reduction
- **Observer effects**: Measurement changes system

### Practical Limitations

- **Funding biases**: Research follows money
- **Career incentives**: Publish or perish
- **Ideological capture**: Political influence
- **Corporate influence**: Industry-funded research
- **Accessibility**: Paywalls limit knowledge spread

## Science and Values

**Fact-value distinction**: Science describes what is, not what ought to be

**Problem**: Policy requires both facts and values, but science only provides facts

**Consequence**: Scientific knowledge insufficient for decision-making without value judgments

## Interconnections

This problem connects to:

- **[Reductionism](./reductionism-holism.md)**: Methodological limits
- **[Moral Frameworks](../religion-philosophy/moral-frameworks.md)**: Science and ethics
